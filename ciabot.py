# Thiu is version 1.1 of ciabot.py
#
# This script contains porcelain and porcelain byproducts.
# It's Python because the Python standard libraries avoid portability/security
# issues raised by callouts in the ancestral Perl and sh scripts.  It should
# be compatible back to Python 2.1.5
#
# It is meant to be run either in a post-commit hook or in an update
# hook.
#
# In post-commit, run it without arguments. It will query for current HEAD and
# the latest commit ID to get the information it needs.
#
# In update, call it with a refname followed by a list of commits.
#
#       ciabot.py ${refname} $(git rev-list ${oldhead}..${newhead} | tac)
#
# Note: this script uses mail, not XML-RPC, in order to avoid stalling
# until timeout when the CIA XML-RPC server is down. 
#
# Call with -n to see the notification mail dumped to stdout rather
# than shipped to CIA. This may be useful for debugging purposes.
#

#
# The project as known to CIA. You will want to change this:
#
project="GPSD"

#
# You may not need to change these:
#
import os, sys, commands, socket, urllib

# Name of the repository.
# You can hardwire this to make the script faster.
repo = os.path.basename(os.getcwd())

# Fully-qualified domain name of this host.
# You can hardwire this to make the script faster.
host = socket.getfqdn()

# Changeset URL prefix for your repo: when the commit ID is appended
# to this, it should point at a CGI that will display the commit
# through gitweb or something similar. The defaults will probably
# work if you have a typical gitweb/cgit setup.
#
#urlprefix="http://%(host)s/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=%(repo)s;a=commit;h="
urlprefix="http://%(host)s/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/%(repo)s/commit/?id="

# The service used to turn your gitwebbish URL into a tinyurl so it
# will take up less space on the IRC notification line.
tinyifier = "http://tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url="

# The template used to generate the XML messages to CIA.  You can make
# visible changes to the IRC-bot notification lines by hacking this.
# The default will produce a notfication line that looks like this:
#
# ${project}: ${author} ${repo}:${branch} * ${rev} ${files}: ${logmsg} ${url}
#
# By omitting $files you can collapse the files part to a single slash.
